# Projects
This repository contains all of my hands-on projects in Machine Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs). It showcases my journey through core ML concepts, end-to-end pipelines, and cutting-edge LLM applications. Each project is well-structured, documented, and aimed at solving real-world or research-inspired problems.
